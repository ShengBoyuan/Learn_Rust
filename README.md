# Learn_Rust
I've been really fascinated by Rust these days, cuz I wanna learn a system programming language since I'm working as a Gopher. Rust which births just near Go comes into my sight.  I'm gonna use Rust to write some little demos here as a recording of my learning path. I'm very glad to communicate CS with anyone who is also interested in it!
